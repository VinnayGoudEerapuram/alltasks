                <p>About Ed Sheeran: 
                    Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music.

                <p>The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
                    So the bar is where I go 
                    Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
                    you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
                    Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
                    And now I’m singing like
                    
                    Girl you know I want your love
                    Your love was handmade for somebody like me
                    Come on now follow my lead
                    I may be crazy don’t mind me 
                    Say boy let’s not talk too much 
                    Grab on my waist and put that body on me
                    Come on now follow my lead
                    Come come on now follow my lead</p>
